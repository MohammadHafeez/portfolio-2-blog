            <p>This week I when I was coding the communication feature I realized that our firebase database does not support querying indented lists. This was a major impediment because one of the main features of our application was to enable users to communicate directly without have to send emails back and forth. At first I was thinking wether or not we should just do a mockup for our presentation. However, some members were unhappy about submitting just a prototype and suggested to contiune by shifting to the microsoft management server SQL. Therefore we continued trudging along and finally completed the communications feature.</p>
