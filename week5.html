            <p>This week was our hackaton week which was divided into 2 days. The first two days were a physical and digital meet ups where I split the work evenly among the group members so that we could complete the remaining tasks left for user stories 4 and 5. We also discussed about our pitching slides and the distrubution of presentation.</p>

            <p>After that during the weekend we had to present our idea to a guest lecturer Mr Phua. He had some positive feedback for our application but pointed out that the way we approached the problem lacked some considerations that may possibly affect other business parties. I was quite disappointed but despite not winning the Hackathon, I was able to better understand how to structure our product to provide maximum benefit for the supply chain.</p>
