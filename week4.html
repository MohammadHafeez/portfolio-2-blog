            <p>This was the last week before the end of sprint 1, and we still had to complete user stories 4 and 5. To meet the requirements of these user stories, I had to overcome an issue I never had to before, uploading and storing images. Thus I had to leverage the storage feature firebase offers and also use javascript to display the images uploaded.</p>

                <img src="./images/week4/image2.png" />
            </div>
            <div class="image__box" >
                <img src="./images/week4/image1.png" />
            </div>
            <p>Once the user stories were completed and tested. My groupmate, Edmund, created all the burndown and burnup charts to track our progress. We also started to work on our Hacakton slides which we would be presenting on Friday the 20th of November. Overall, I was very proud of my team this sprint as everyone knew what to do and was always up to the task. This was a relief as a scrum master as I did not have to micromanage everyone.</p>
