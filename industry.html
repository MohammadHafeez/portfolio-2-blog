            <p>This talk was beneficial as it allowed me to understand the nuances that affect the global supply chain systems and why many countries could not adapt to the changes that COVID-19 brought about. Furthermore, the talk also mentioned leveraging blockchain technology to increase transparency in the supply chain system and machine learning to stress test and model specific scenarios to overcome future challenges better. However, to implement these technologies, I must first learn them. Luckily for the next semester, I can take two elective modules called deep learning and cloud architecture technologies and continue to improve my skills.</p>

            <p>This talk was extremely relevant to my course and even more so than the previous talk because of the modules FI students took last semester. IT students could take WEB and FSD, which allowed them to learn both JavaScript and c#. However, FI students could only take WEB and do not have any JavaScript experience, which is a considerable disadvantage when it comes to building web applications. Therefore, by learning the Blazor framework, I can build on our previous WEB knowledge to learnt newer and more efficient ways to complete the tasks which could not be completed before. This was an excellent opportunity for me, as I am an aspiring software developer.</p>
            <p>All in all, attending both talks allowed me to better understand why the supply chain industry could not meet customer demands during the COVID-19 period and gained insight into which technologies can be leveraged to revolutionize the supply chain industry. These insights allowed me to develop the hybrid supply chain system that I could mock with my current coding skills for my P2 assignment. Furthermore, the second talk was a way for me to map out how which technologies I should learn and the order I should learn them. These insights were even more critical as I created a custom developer roadmap for myself, which is essential for staying relevant and competitive in the job market.</p>
