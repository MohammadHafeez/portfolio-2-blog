            <p>This is the week when we finally started to develop our website. We first created a prototype on figma.com so that our team had a pretty good idea on what was going on. Thus, we had a reliable guide which we could follow and ensure there were no deviations to our design.</p>

            <p>Once our prototype was finalized, we started on our application development. We used a cloud storage called firebase to ensure that any changes are synced across all our devices. During this week, I personally created the sign in and sign up function with data validation to allow users to access our website either as suppliers or buyers.</p>

            <p>During this week, we fulfilled user stories 1 to 3 and were on schedule to complete the remaining sprints by week 4.</p>
