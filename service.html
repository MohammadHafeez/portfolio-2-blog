            <p>My group was required to create a deck of slides regarding PAYLAH and its features beforehand, as well as to come up with some possible questions and answers that the elderly might ask. My contributions to my groups' presentation include the signup portion of the slides and creating videos that the elderly could watch to understand our presentation better. We knew that the elderly would have a hard time seeing bright and low contrast visualizations which is why my group decided to design a presentation deck which was engaging and clear enough. We also included some videos for the elderly to watch so that they remain engaged.</p>

            </div>
            <p>However, during our presentation when I was presenting my part where the elderly had to sign up for their DBS Paylah account, almost all the elderly left the call probably because zoom kicked them out the breakout room when they left the zoom app to go to the DBS Paylah App. Luckily one elderly remained, and I was able to present to her successfully.</p>

            <p>Overall, throughout the experience from learning about the difficulties these elderly face during our research to communicating with one of them and placing myself in their shoes I was able to better understand how the elderly feel. I am now more grateful for things such as my education and the comfortable life I can live which I previously took for granted. By going through this service learning project, I learnt that we as the younger generation are responsible for the older generation and should continue to teach and serve them as I would like to be treated like this in the future too.</p>
