            <p>This is the end of sprint four and the final presentation week. Luckily, we managed to complete our coding. What i did this week was to help a little with the presentation slides with my group members and also completed the swithing of the supply chain system feature. The presentation was smooth and I am pleased that our lecturer found the idea of creating two different types of supply chain interesting. Overall, my group members did a great job and we had minimum conflict and smooth communication. </p>
