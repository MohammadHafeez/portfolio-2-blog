            <p>This week we came back from the long break to kick start sprint three. During the holidays I did some research based on the feedback given by Mr Phua during. I shared my findings with our team and we all decided that following my new idea made sense. Thus began the process of delegating tasks to my group members and I had to make sure evryone was clear about the agenda. I also divided my group into the coding and design team to better make use of our skills.</p>
