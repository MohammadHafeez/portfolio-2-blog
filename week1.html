            <p>This journey first began by me picking the theme “Supply Chain in a pandemic”. I was drawn to this theme because I had learnt quite a bit about supply chain systems during the previous semester and wanted to use my skills to try and create a better and more efficient supply chain system, especially during this covid 19 period.</p>
            <p>During lesson time, our lecturer asked our whole class to brainstorm some ideas and each, and every one of us voted for the ideas that we thought would best tackle a disrupted supply chain during this covid 19 pandemic. Surprisingly, my idea of a digital market place where suppliers and buyers can come together and perform transactions was the second most voted idea, which resulted in me becoming a scrum master.</p>
            <p>Our lecturer then told us that the scrum masters got to choose their teammates, albeit with a twist. The twist was we had to choose our teammates depending on their strengths (submitted anonymously on google forms). I was quite nervous during the selection period, but at the end of the day, my group mates had skillsets quite different from mine, which made us quite well rounded.</p>
